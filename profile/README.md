## What Is Leanbiome™?

LeanBiome is a scientifically formulated sports nutritional supplement designed to support gut health and enhance overall nutrition. Offered in various formats, including sachets, bakery products, and snack bars, Lean-Biome is developed by OptiBiotix, a company specializing in microbiome modulation and functional food ingredients.

The supplement combines dietary and prebiotic fibers along with a trace mineral to promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, which is essential for good digestion. According to the official website, Lean-Biome is particularly beneficial for nutrition enthusiasts, as it aids in the development of lean muscle mass while increasing fiber intake. This is crucial, as many adults struggle to meet the recommended daily fiber intake of 30 grams.

LeanBiome provides 9 grams of fiber per serving, with over 60% of this being prebiotic fiber. This composition not only supports optimal digestive performance but also offers various functional benefits, including improved metabolism and enhanced gut health. Additionally, users may experience reduced cravings and a feeling of fullness, making it easier to maintain a balanced diet.

In summary, Lean-Biome is a versatile supplement aimed at promoting a diverse microbiome and supporting overall health through increased fiber consumption.

## How Do Lean-Biome Weight Loss Supplements Work?

LeanBiome works by enhancing the overall health of the gastrointestinal tract, commonly referred to as the gut, to facilitate weight loss. The supplement utilizes beneficial bacteria to promote a healthy microbiome within the digestive system, which includes various organs from the mouth to the anus.

Developed by OptiBiotix, LeanBiome is based on the science of targeted microbiome modulation. The formulation is backed by extensive research conducted by specialists in biological psychology, health behaviors, and functional food science. This research supports the efficacy of Lean-Biome in improving lean body composition by reducing fat intake and curbing food cravings.

Clinical studies conducted by OptiBiotix have demonstrated that Lean-Biome can lead to statistically significant improvements in body composition, including reductions in waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage, and overall body weight and BMI. Notably, after four weeks of consumption, Lean-Biome has also been shown to enhance gut microbiome diversity, which is an important factor in overall health and weight management.

- **Bifidobacterium**: A well-established group of bacteria present in the gut microbiome, recognized for its numerous health benefits.
- **Christensenellaceae**: A specific category of microbes increasingly associated with maintaining lean body mass.
- **Bacteroides**: Known for low levels being linked to reduced VO2 max.

In conjunction with a healthy and balanced diet, Lean-Biome helps regulate blood sugar levels within a normal range, which can diminish cravings for unhealthy sweet foods.

## Probiotic Strains for Weight Loss and Gut Health

LeanBiome contains a unique blend of *Lactobacillus gasseri*, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*, and *Lactobacillus fermentum* — three potent probiotics known to support weight management and improve gut health. These probiotics help:

- **Reduce abdominal fat**: Particularly *Lactobacillus gasseri*, which is linked to reduced fat accumulation.
- **Curbs cravings**: *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* is known to reduce hunger and emotional eating.
- **Enhance digestion**: All three strains improve digestion, boost nutrient absorption, and balance gut bacteria for optimal metabolic function.

## Greenselect Phytosome®: Natural Fat Burner

Greenselect Phytosome® is a caffeine-free green tea extract that boosts your metabolism without causing jitters or sleep disruptions. By increasing fat-burning processes, this extract helps your body:

- **Boost metabolism**: It accelerates fat breakdown and supports healthy weight loss.
- **Fight oxidative stress**: Provides antioxidants to protect against free radicals and improve overall health.

## Inulin (Chicory Root Extract) for Digestive Health

Inulin, a natural prebiotic fiber, feeds beneficial gut bacteria, helping to improve digestion and nutrient absorption. It also helps:

- **Control appetite**: By promoting feelings of fullness and reducing cravings.
- **Support gut health**: Enhances healthy gut flora and digestive functions, contributing to overall wellness.

## Ingredients of Leanbiome™ Supplement

The LeanBiome formula blends several key probiotic strains and natural ingredients designed to support gut health and metabolism, aiding in weight management. Some of its main ingredients include:

- **Chicory Root (Source of Inulin)**: This plant, belonging to the dandelion family, is often used as a coffee alternative. Lean-Biome incorporates chicory root, which is a soluble fiber that helps reduce appetite and promotes a feeling of fullness for an extended period. This ingredient contributes to satiety and minimizes food cravings.

- **Lactobacillus rhamnosus**: Another probiotic included in the formulation, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* is naturally found in the intestines. It plays a crucial role in converting lactose from food into lactic acid and is commonly added to dairy products to enhance their probiotic content. In Lean-Biome, *L. rhamnosus* supports weight loss and maintenance, while also helping to prevent diarrhea, vomiting, gastric infections, and the progression of immune diseases.

- **Lactobacillus gasseri**: This strain of beneficial bacteria is naturally present in the digestive and urinary tracts and can be found in certain food sources. *Lactobacillus gasseri* is known to reduce inflammation, which aids in fat loss and contributes to a decrease in body fat percentage, thereby supporting lean muscle mass.

- **Green Select Phytosome**: This ingredient is an extract derived from organic green tea, rich in polyphenols and known for its caffeine-free properties. In Lean-Biome, Green Select Phytosome acts as a detoxifying agent, helping to eliminate harmful toxins, reduce inflammation, and combat oxidative stress. Additionally, it provides antioxidant support to the body.

- **Lactobacillus fermentum**: *Lactobacillus fermentum* is indeed a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium commonly found in fermenting animal and plant matter. It plays a significant role in various fermentation processes and is also a notable component of the human microbiome, contributing to gut health and overall microbial balance.

- **Bifidobacterium**: *Bifidobacterium longum* is a significant species found primarily in the vagina and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It plays a crucial role in digestive health by producing lactic acid through the fermentation of carbohydrates, which helps to regulate and lower the pH in the colon.
